# TheTemplarBot
## A Telegram Bot that uses the Instagram API to search for recent followers that might be bots.

The bot needs some credentials before it will work properly.

In boy.py, replace \<TELETOKEN\> with the bot token you recieved from Telegram when setting up a new bot.

Replace \<INSTAUSER\> with your Instagram username. You can supply credentials to any account and it will work, but it does need valid login credentials to contact the API.

Replace \<INSTAPASS\> with your Instagram password.
