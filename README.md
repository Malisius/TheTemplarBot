# TheTemplarBot
A Telegram Bot that uses the Instagram API to search for recent followers that might be bots.

The bot needs some credentials before it will work properly.
In boy.py, replace <TELETOKEN> with the bot token you recieved from Telegram when setting up a new bot.
Replace <INSTAUSER> with your Instagram username. You can supply credentials to any account and it will work, but it does need valid login credentials to contact the API.
Replace <INSTAPASS> with your Instagram password.
